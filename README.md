# Automating-Hospitality-A-Python-MySQL-Connectivity-Hotel-Management-System
### Brief Overview
The Python SQL Connectivity Hotel Management Project aims to streamline and simplify day-to-day activities of a hotel, automating processes such as room management, customer check-in and checkout, room assignment based on customer requirements, and bill computation. These tasks are typically performed regularly and need efficient, fast, reliable, and user-friendly systems to enhance operational efficiency and guest experience.

To provide efficient , fast, reliable and user-friendly system is
the basic motto behind this exercise .And show the Hotel room
facilities, Book room. The main aim of the entireactivity is to
automate the process of day to day activities of Hotellike Room
activities, Admission of a New Customer, Assign a

* `Billing:` Calculate bills based on room type, duration of stay, and additional services.
* `Restaurant Management:` Display menu, take orders, calculate restaurant bills.
* `Laundry Services:` Calculate laundry bills based on items.
* `Database Integration:` Utilizes MySQL for storing and retrieving hotel and guest information.

#### Technologies Used
* `Python:` Backend development for business logic and user interaction.
* `MySQL:` Database management system for efficient data storage and retrieval.
* `MySQL Connector/Python:` Python driver for connecting and executing SQL statements with MySQL.
* `Datetime:` Handle date and time operations for managing check-in and check-out dates.
* `Pandas (Optional):` Data analysis and manipulation library used if needed for data processing tasks.
#### Required Packages
 1. `mysql-connector-python:` For connecting your Python application to a MySQL database.
```
pip install mysql-connector-python
```

2. `mysql.connector:` This module provides a way to connect to a MySQL database server from a Python application. 
It enables executing SQL queries, retrieving data, and managing the database, making it essential for applications that need to interact with a MySQL database.
 
3. `datetime:` Standard library for manipulating dates and times.
4. `os:`  This module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality. Common uses include interacting with the file system (reading, writing, and managing files and directories), handling environment variables, and executing system commands.

#### Advantages
1. Sometime it happens that the rooms get
booked soon when one visitsthe place
therefore user can make advance booking
using this system.
2. It saves user time in searching a room.
3. The system is useful as it calculates an
exact cost of rooms for requested number
of days.

4. It saves organization resources and
expenses.
5. This system is effective and saves time and
cost of users.
6. Automation: Automates repetitive hotel management tasks, reducing manual effort and errors.
7. Efficiency: Improves operational efficiency with fast and reliable data processing.
8. User-Friendly: Provides a straightforward interface for staff to manage hotel operations.

#### Disadvantages

1. The booking process usually requires
a customer identity, which the
system cannot detect.
2. It requires a reliable internet
connection.
